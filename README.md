## 📖 About rankfuse

rankfuse helps improve search results by combining and reordering them. Many search tools give you results, but they might not be sorted in the best way. rankfuse reranks results to show you the most useful ones first. It also fuses results from different search systems to provide a better overall list. This can help you find what you want faster and easier.

rankfuse works well with systems that retrieve or generate information, such as search engines and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups. It uses techniques like cross-encoders to compare the relevance of results.
